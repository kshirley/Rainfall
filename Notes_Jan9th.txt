Kenny:

1. Look up  papers that cite Sanso & Guenni 2000.
 - JABES
 - Bayesian Analysis
These are possible outlets for our paper.

2. Ask Dan about updated data for all 15 time series.

3. Consider some out-of-sample (one-year-ahead) predictions.
  - maybe there is some quantity of interest that we really care about, like onset time, or sum of rainfall over some stretch of time...

4. Update the model writeup (the current version is the occurrence of rainfall, rather than the tobit model).
