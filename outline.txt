1 Motivation & Intro (both edit)

2 Data (almost done)

3 EDA (almost done)

4 The Model (kenny finish explanation)

5 Fitting the model (kenny and katya  - maybe kenny appendix to show multivariate t mixture)

6 Simulation Study (optional) Kenny to update with new model

7 Results (fit to all data, discuss inferences) kind of short.
  focus on:
    - ARC bias,
    - site-scpecific covariance matrices
    - spatial correlation
    - El nino effects


8 Out of sample predictions (hoepfully show our model does a bit better than simpler models)
  - remove one series from a site
    - make predictions under a few different models

      * increasingly complex models:
      a. just use the one time series
      b. use all 15 (or 14) series, but no spatial dependence
      c. assume independence between series at a given site
      d. our model


2 estimands: mean daily during the wet season, and onset
same loss function: rmse (mm for daily mean and days for onset)


Then... done!


To do:
kenny: clean up code in mcmc_baseline.R
 - spacing
 - create a data setup file to include scripts for setting up data and creating tidy versions
 - read in tidy data
 - remove references to 0/1 model for rainfall ("x" and "y")
 - investigate w.draw and n.draw... (relics from binary model?)
 - clean up the two .c functions by reading warnings from compiler
 - add .o and .so files to the .gitignore
 - re-run simulation study on this model to double-check
   - investigate alpha draw, especially
