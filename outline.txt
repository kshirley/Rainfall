1 Motivation & Intro (both edit)

  -The Adi ha new sereis was our original the motivation--we'd like to predict this short station using other series like ARC.
  -But for the purposes of this paper, we won't use adi ha in our experiment, as we don't have enough historical data to check if the model is performing well. 
  -So rather, we eliminate the last 3 years of hagersalam station, and check if we can reproduce it. 

2 Data (almost done)

3 EDA (almost done)

4 The Model (kenny finish explanation)

5 Fitting the model (kenny and katya  - maybe kenny appendix to show multivariate t mixture)
 - appendix of the gibbs sampling steps (kenny)
 - discussion (finish the discussion of the steps for fitting the model)

6 Simulation Study (optional) Kenny to update with new model
 - choose somewhat realistic parameter settings and show a couple of trace plots of the challenging/interesting parameters
 - update 7/1/15 probably not include this in final paper, since we are seeing good convergence on real data.

7 Results (fit to all data, discuss inferences). Run should probably be 20k iterations, just to be safe.
  focus on:
    - ARC bias, (mu_arc)
    - site-scpecific covariance matrices (Sigma)
    - spatial correlation (lambda)
    - El nino effects (some betas)
    - check variances (tau)
    - Plot of the seasonal mean (betas)

  Notes:
  (1) run for 5k, get an idea of posterior means, then set starting points to be +/- 3 or 4 standard deviations from posterior means
  (2) set up "adapt"to be 2,000, and look at trace plots
  (3) maybe set burn-in to be ~10000 iterations
  (4) maybe do thinning, so look at every fifth iteration out of 10,000 post-burnin, for example for a 2,000 point posterior sample for each parameter.
  (5) compute gelman-rubin statistics for each of the 224 parameters
  (6) Do inference, discuss, etc. Maybe a nice plot of posterior means and standard errors (horizontal bar-type plot).



7/1/15 update - stuff to write in Section 7:
--------------

- we did trace plots for each parameter (show lambda, tau, and one 2x2 covariance matrix)
- we computed gelman-rubin statistic for each parameter, and all were relatively small except for February Nino Effect
- We computed posterior means and standard errors for each parmater; they are available in the supplemental material
- Plot the posterior mean of mu to show overall time series pattern
- Related: plot the posterior mean of P(wet) and mean mm per day.


Also include some posterior predictive checks.
 - Mean rainfall by month
 - Proportion of wet days per month
 - Interannual variability

Discuss the meaning of the spatial correlation estimate. If lambda = 0.07, what does this really mean? recall that distance is scaled. For example, at what distance does the sparial correlation drop below 0.05?

We can say we're obviously measuring the March-April "hump" in rainfall, before the July-August wet season.

Show the estimated correlation matrices for all 6 locations.



In the discussion: Explain that this helps us build an insurance product that can blend info from various local measurement devices, increasing trust.



Update 7/1/15: maybe we don't have to bother with this for the first draft at least:

8 Out of sample predictions (hopefully show our model does a bit better than simpler models)
  Experiment 1: remove one series from a site, and only one 2-4 year time span from that series
    - hager selam 2005 - 2008 station
    - make predictions under a few different models:

      * increasingly complex models:
      a. just use the one time series, up until the data were removed (remove all other data)
      b. use all 15 (or 14 b/c of Adi Ha new is so short) series, but no spatial dependenc (lambda = 0)
      c. assume independence between series at a given site (Sigmas are all diagonal 1's)
      d. our model

3 estimands: 
  (1) predict every day of rainfall for 3 months per year (90 * 4 = 360 predictions)
  (2) the day of onset (4 predictions)
  (3) the number of 7-day droughts in the 90 days following onset of the season


same loss function: rmse (mm for daily mean and daily rainfall, and days for onset)






Then... done!


To do:
kenny: clean up code in mcmc_baseline.R
 - spacing
 - create a data setup file to include scripts for setting up data and creating tidy versions
 - read in tidy data
 - remove references to 0/1 model for rainfall ("x" and "y")
 - investigate w.draw and n.draw... (relics from binary model?)
 - clean up the two .c functions by reading warnings from compiler
 - add .o and .so files to the .gitignore
 - re-run simulation study on this model to double-check
   - investigate alpha draw, especially
 - Play around with how fat tails should be on t distribution--namely alpha=5 or giving alpha a tight prior between -3 and 30

katya: 
 - re-run the baseline study with 5,000 runs
 - set up the first experiment removing last 3 years of hager salam station (series 1)
