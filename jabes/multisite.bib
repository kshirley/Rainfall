abstract = {The familiar chain-dependent-process stochastic model of daily precipitation, consisting of a two-state, first-order Markov chain for occurrences and a mixed exponential distribution for nonzero amounts, is extended to simultaneous simulation at multiple locations by driving a collection of individual models with serially independent but spatially correlated random numbers. The procedure is illustrated for a network of 25 locations in New York state, with interstation separations ranging approximately from 10 to 500km. The resulting process reasonably reproduces various aspects of the joint distribution of daily precipitation observations at the modeled locations. The mixed exponential distributions, in addition to providing substantially better fits than the more conventional gamma distributions, are convenient for representing the tendency for smaller amounts at locations near the edges of wet areas. Means, variances, and interstation correlations of monthly precipitation totals are also well reproduced. In addition, the use of mixed exponential rather than gamma distributions yields interannual variability in the synthetic series that is much closer to the observed.},

Means of yearly maxima and return values of daily synthetic precipitation were within the 95\% confidence intervals (CI95) of observed data for all sites. Daily maximum temperature extremes were reproduced less accurately. Although the root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated for the means of maxima of maximum temperature was <1°C, synthetic means for approximately half of the sites were outside the CI95 for observed values. This indicates that the assumption used in LARS-WG, that daily temperature could be approximated by the normal distribution, is inadequate. Means of yearly maxima for length of heat waves and 10 and 20 yr return values were within the CI95 for all sites except 3.

abstract = {Long samples of weather data are frequently needed to evaluate the long-term effects of proposed hydrologic changes. The evaluations are often undertaken using deterministic mathematical models that require daily weather data as input. Stochastic generation of the required weather data offers an attractive alternative to the use of observed weather records. This paper presents an approach that may be used to generate long samples of daily precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and solar radiation. Precipitation is generated independently of the other variables by using a Markov chain-exponential model. The other three variables are generated by using a multivariate model with the means and standard deviations of the variables conditioned on the wet or dry status of the day as determined by the precipitation model. Daily weather samples that are generated with this approach preserve the seasonal and statistical characteristics of each variable and the interrelations among the four variables that exist in the observed data.},

abstract = {A daily stochastic spatiotemporal precipitation generator that yields spatially consistent gridded quantitative precipitation realizations is described. The methodology relies on a latent Gaussian process to drive precipitation occurrence and a probability integral transformed Gaussian process for intensity. At individual locations, the model reduces to a Markov chain for precipitation occurrence and a gamma distribution for precipitation intensity, allowing statistical parameters to be included in a generalized linear model framework. Statistical parameters are modeled as spatial Gaussian processes, which allows for interpolation to locations where there are no direct observations via kriging. One advantage of such a model for the statistical parameters is that stochastic generator parameters are immediately available at any location, with the ability to adapt to spatially varying precipitation characteristics. A second advantage is that parameter uncertainty, generally unavailable with deterministic interpolators, can be immediately quantified at all locations. The methodology is illustrated on two data sets, the first in Iowa and the second over the Pampas region of Argentina. In both examples, the method is able to capture the local and domain aggregated precipitation behavior fairly well at a wide range of time scales, including daily, monthly, and annually.},

To do this, some of the parameters of the model are themselves sampled randomly. The model has been fitted to over 40 sites in the tropics. The model was tested in detail for three sites in Central and South America and in the African Sahel. Few significant differences were found between the historical and simulated means and variances of yearly and monthly rainfall amount and raindays per month. There were some problems with simulating wet and dry sequences of longer than 9 days. When historical and simulated rainfall records were used to drive a crop simulation model, there was no significant difference in the mean and variance of maize yield response.

abstract = {Rain-fed agriculture is extremely important in sub-Saharan Africa, thus the ability to forecast and monitor regional crop yields throughout the growing season would be of enormous benefit to decision makers. Of equal importance to be able to assign a measure of uncertainty to the forecast, especially considering that many predictions are made in the context of a complex climate and sparse meteorological and agricultural observations. This work investigates these issues in the context of an operational updating regional crop yield forecast, concentrating in particular on a case study forecasting Ethiopian maize. Part 1 of the work presented a detailed discussion of Ethiopia?s climate and agricultural systems. As real-time ground based weather observations are sparse in Africa, Part 2 contains an investigation into remotely sensed satellite rainfall estimates. A daily TAMSAT calibration and the geostatistical process of sequential simulation were used to create a spatially correlated ensemble of Meteosat-derived rainfall estimates. The ensemble mean was evaluated as a daily deterministic rainfall product and was found to be as good as or better than other products applied in the same region. A validation of the full ensemble showed that they realistically estimated Ethiopian rainfall fields that agreed both with observed spatial correlations and input pixel level statistics. Part 3 of the work includes a discussion on regional crop simulation modelling and presents a new parameterisation of the GLAM crop simulation model for tropical maize. GLAMMAIZE was then driven using individual members of the satellite ensemble; this was shown to exhibit the correct sensitivities to climate inputs and performed reasonably against yield observations. Finally, Part 4 presented a new method of creating stochastic spatially and temporally correlated rainfall fields. This ?regional weather generator? was tested using a case study on Ethiopian April rainfall and a detailed discussion was included about future development plans.},

abstract = {Stochastic weather generators are commonly used to generate scenarios of climate variability or change on a daily timescale. So the realistic modeling of extreme events is essential. Presently, parametric weather generators do not produce a heavy enough upper tail for the distribution of daily precipitation amount, whereas those based on resampling have inherent limitations in representing extremes. Regarding this issue, we first describe advanced statistical tools from ultimate and penultimate extreme value theory to analyze and model extremal behavior of precipitation intensity (i.e., nonzero amount), which, although interesting in their own right, are mainly used to motivate approaches to improve the treatment of extremes within a weather generator framework. To this end we propose and discuss several possible approaches, none of which resolves the problem at hand completely, but at least one of them (i.e., a hybrid technique with a gamma distribution for low to moderate intensities and a generalized Pareto distribution for high intensities) can lead to a substantial improvement. An alternative approach, based on fitting the stretched exponential (or Weibull) distribution to either all or only high intensities, is found difficult to implement in practice.},

We demonstrate that generalized linear models (GLMs) can-provide a general modeling framework, allowing the straightforward incorporation of annual cycles and other covariates (e.g. an index of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, ENSO) into stochastic weather generators. We apply the GLM technique to daily time series of weather variables (i.e. precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature) from Pergamino, Argentina. Besides annual cycles, the fit is significantly improved by permitting both the transition probabilities of the first-order Markov chain for daily precipitation occurrence, as well as the means of both daily minimum and maximum temperature, to depend on the ENSO state. Although it is more parsimonious than typical weather generators, the GLM-based weather generator performs comparably, particularly in terms of extremes and overdispersion.},

abstract = {We propose a semiparametric multivariate weather generator with greater ability to reproduce the historical statistics, especially the wet and dry spells. The proposed approach has two steps: (1) a Markov Chain for generating the precipitation state (i.e., no rain, rain, or heavy rain), and (2) a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) bootstrap resampler for generating the multivariate weather variables. The Markov Chain captures the spell statistics while the k-NN bootstrap captures the distributional and lag-dependence statistics of the weather variables. Traditional k-NN generators tend to under-simulate the wet and dry spells that are keys to watershed and agricultural modeling for water planning and management; hence the motivation for this research. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and its improvement over the traditional k-NN approach through an application to daily weather data from Pergamino in the Pampas region of Argentina. We show the applicability of the proposed framework in simulating weather scenarios conditional on the seasonal climate forecast and also at multiple sites in the Pampas region.},

@article{Racsko1991,
abstract = {Crop growth simulation models have been studied and constructed by many authors, including the authors of this paper. It was realized that the available local time series of the weather parameters are not numerous or long enough for a good statistical identification of the model's parameters, and they are too short if one aims at generating the multidimensional probability distribution of the output parameters for the stochastic input variables. Thus it was decided to construct a stochastic weather ?generator? that provides as long a time series as is necessary and as many repetitions as the simulations experiments require. The weather ?generator? must, of course, be statistically identical to the observed time series. The paper gives a description of the weather generator developed by the authors. The generator contains a stochastic weather model based on a new approach to weather data analysis and also a computer program package that carries out the tuning of the model on real time series and generates the random weather processes. The model was identified and applied to two geographical locations in Hungary.},
